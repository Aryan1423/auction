    name: "2012 Nissan GT-R Black Edition",
    image: Car1,
    skills: "",
    detail: "This particular GT-R is a desirable Black Edition model, featuring some great upgrades from the standard GT-R, like 20-inch RAYS forged wheels, a carbon fiber rear spoiler, and a handsome two-tone interior with Recaro seats. It's also mostly unmodified, which is a great benefit, as the next owner can upgrade it or drive it like this – where it's plenty fast for virtually any situation."

    name: "2018 Dodge Challenger",
    image: Car2,
    skills: "",
    detail: "No car better embodies the muscle car spirit of the 1960s than the Dodge Challenger. It's seriously fast, it's unapologetically loud, and it's best enjoyed with V8 power. This particular Challenger is an SRT 392 model, meaning it touts a naturally-aspirated 6.4-liter Hemi V8 rated at a muscular 485 horsepower when left stock. But this example is far from stock – it's one of 10 Challengers to receive the Super Wasp treatment from Steve White Motors in Hickory, North Carolina. It notably touts a Magnuson supercharger, which should significantly increase its power – and it features Kooks long-tube headers, Eibach lowering springs, custom exterior and interior trim, Hurst wheels, and a Katzkin leather interior. This Challenger is also offered with a clean, accident-free Carfax report showing ownership in warmer-climate Southern states since new, for added buyer confidence."

    name: "2006 Mercedes-Benz C230 Sedan",
    image: Car4,
    skills: "",
    detail : "The Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan from this era is a nice car with graceful lines – and the later models, like this one, benefited from updated engines and 7-speed automatic transmissions. This particular example is a V6-powered C230, and it features impressively low mileage for one of these, with just 18,800 miles shown. It's also unmodified, and it features AMG body styling, a handsome set of 17-inch alloy wheels, and sport seats. Plus, this C230 benefits from a lifetime spent mostly in warm-weather Texas, and it comes with a clean, accident-free Carfax report. Finally, no reserve means someone is taking home this C-Class at the end of the auction."

  {
    name: "2008 Dodge Charger R/T",
    image: Car3,
    skills: "",
    detail : "Finding an older Dodge Charger in clean, stock condition is getting really hard – which is why this particular R/T is special. This Charger R/T is completely unmodified, it has a big Hemi V8 under the hood, and touts an impressively low 31,900 miles from new! It also has some great equipment, with power-adjustable heated performance bucket seats, a navigation system, and a Boston Acoustics sound system. This Charger also boasts a clean, accident-free Carfax report that shows ownership in warm-climate Florida from new, further adding to the appeal."

  {
    name: "1996 Nissan Skyline GTS-25T",
    image: Car5,
    skills: "",
    detail : "It's an E30-generation BMW 3 Series that started life as a lowly 325e with an automatic transmission – but it's now reportedly powered by a 325is-sourced 2.5-liter straight-6, so it's more powerful than stock, and it boasts a 5-speed manual transmission that enhances the driving experience further. This E30 also features several suspension modifications that should improve handling, including aftermarket shocks and springs – yet it looks nearly unmodified when viewed from the outside. Other benefits include a clean, accident-free Carfax history report for peace of mind, and the excitement of no reserve."
